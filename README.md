# Notey

## Description
This app allows everyone to leave notes for others to see. Everyone can add or remove all notes. I wanted to try my hand at making an app that will allow users to save notes for themselves that could be accessed anywhere. A computer can do this but what if I needed to pull it up on my phone. Well thats what this app does, its a website to store your notes. I dont have authentication for users and notes stored that way but this is part one. Figuring out how to store the files on the web server was really hard. The location is not permanent but for a quick start it will work for until I am ready to put everything on a database.

## Install
N/A just go to the website

## Usage
Go to: ![Website Link](https://notey.herokuapp.com/)
Select "Get Started"
To make a new note:
    Hit the plus sign in the upper right hand corner
    Enter text into the title block
    Enter text into the text block
    Press the floppy disk that showed up next to the plus sign to save
    Your note is not in the left hand column of notes
If others have already put notes in you can click on the note in the left column and see the full description for that note.
To delete a note select the red trash can button
To edit a note:
    Select the note in the left column
    Select the title or text field and edit the values
    Press the floppy disk icon in the upper right corner to save the changes
